            I&apos;m Jason, an up-and-coming frontend developer from Santa Ana,
            CA. My goals are simple: to create awesome and useful software!

        As a kid, I loved firing up Notepad++ and designing small websites to
        show off to my friends and family. However, I took a brief 15-year
        hiatus due to conflicts of interest known as school and military
        service.

        I studied electrical engineering at Stanford where I specialized in
        image and signal processing. That&apos;s just a fancy way of saying that
        I spent too much time in MATLAB. Too too much time.

        After I graduated, I joined the Marine Corps. Probably the most
        questionable decision of my life, but it was an interesting one
        nonetheless. 5811: Can&apos;t spell CHUMP without MP, amirite?

        Somehow the stars aligned for me because I completed my service in the
        midst of a global pandemic and an economic downturn. On the bright side,
        the social distancing has worked in my favor since now I can focus on
        writing code and working towards my goals as a self-taught frontend
        developer{' '}
